Engine for Nuclear Level Matching
======================================

# High-level Structure and Workflow Explanation:
-------------------------

1. **Data Loading & Standardization** (`load_levels_from_json`):
   - Parse ENSDF JSON (datasets A, B, C) into flat records: energy_value, energy_uncertainty, spin_parity_list, spin_parity_string, dataset_code, level_id.

2. **Physics-Informed Feature Space** (from Feature_Engineer):
   - Compute [Energy_Similarity, Spin_Similarity, Parity_Similarity, Specificity, Gamma_Decay_Pattern_Similarity].
   - All features are monotonic increasing: higher value strictly indicates better match likelihood.

3. **Model Training** (XGBoost and LightGBM with monotone constraints):
   - Train binary logistic regressor on synthetic physics-labeled pairs from Feature_Engineer.
   - Monotone constraints: all five features constrained positive to preserve physics priors.
   - Feature Correlation: Model learns that perfect spin+parity can "rescue" mediocre energy similarity.
   - XGBoost: Standard robust performance.
   - LightGBM: Optimized for comparison and validation.

4. **Pairwise Inference** (cross-dataset only):
   - Enumerate all level pairs across datasets, extract features, predict match probability pair-by-pair.
   - Keep pairs above pairwise_output_threshold (default 0.1%) and write Output_Level_Pairwise_Inference.txt.

5. **Graph Clustering (rule-based, no ML)**:
   - Greedy merge clusters in probability order with dataset-uniqueness and all-to-all compatibility checks (threshold clustering_merge_threshold=0.15).
   - Support multi-cluster membership for ambiguous levels; output clusters to Output_Clustering_Results.txt with anchor and member probabilities.

# 1. Test Data Ingestion (From JSON files)
# ==========================================

# ==========================================
# 2. Model Training (Physics-Informed XGBoost + LightGBM Ensemble)
# ==========================================
# Feature Vector: [Energy_Similarity, Spin_Similarity, Parity_Similarity, Specificity, Gamma_Decay_Pattern_Similarity]
# All Features Monotonic Increasing (higher value → higher match probability):
# 1. Energy_Similarity (+1): Gaussian kernel exp(-0.1×z²) where z=ΔE/σ_combined. Perfect overlap (z=0)→1.0, far apart (z>5)→~0.0
# 2. Spin_Similarity (+1): Best-case compatibility across spin options. Firm match→1.0, tentative match→0.9, adjacent mismatch→0.05-0.2, incompatible→0.0
# 3. Parity_Similarity (+1): Best-case compatibility across parity options. Firm match→1.0, tentative match→0.9, opposite parity→0.0-0.1
# 4. Specificity (+1): Ambiguity penalty = 1/sqrt(multiplicity). Single Jπ→1.0, double options→0.71, triple options→0.58, high ambiguity→0.33
# 5. Gamma_Decay_Pattern_Similarity (+1): Cosine similarity of Gaussian-broadened spectra. Perfect match→1.0, no overlap→0.0, missing data→0.5 (neutral)
#
# Note: Certainty features removed (redundant - tentativeness already encoded in similarity scores via 1.0 vs 0.9 penalty)
